# Linking Up

Two devices running slot can link up like two Game Boys with a cable between them. Trade Pokémon, battle, or race in Mario Kart.

There's no cable. One device runs its own Wi-Fi network and the other joins it. You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi.

!!! info "Linking is local only"
    
    Link play does not work over the internet and adding this feature is not planned.

## Linking

1. Both players open the same game.
2. Press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> + <kbd>MENU</kbd>.
3. One player picks Host, the other picks Join.

The host waits 30 seconds for the joiner to show up. The game may reload once while it gets ready for the link.

To unlink, press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> + <kbd>MENU</kbd> again and pick End Link.

Closing the lid, powering off or ejecting also ends a link session.

## Linking with Kid Mode

A device in Kid Mode can't open the link menu.

When you host a game that's on the kid's card, an invite pops up on their screen with your nickname and the game. <kbd>A</kbd> joins and <kbd>B</kbd> is Not now.

A few gotchas to be aware of:

- Their device needs the same BIOS setup as yours.
- If you're running a different emulator, theirs switches to match for this link session.
- slot makes them a save state before the link starts. When the link ends, they're back in their own game.
- A device in Kid Mode can only join a link session.

## Which games can link

It depends on the game and the emulator.

### On mGBA

Game Boy, Game Boy Color and GBA games on mGBA link like a cable. The host sends its game over and both devices run the same thing in lockstep. That's how Mario Kart works.

While you're linked like this, the joining player is playing the host's game. Your own save and resume state on the joining device are left alone.

Both devices need the same BIOS setup. If one has a `gba_bios.bin` and the other doesn't, the link ends with "BIOS does not match".

### On gpSP

gpSP does the GBA link cable for Pokémon and both Advance Wars, and the wireless adapter for FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald.

Trading Pokémon? Put the game on gpSP first with <kbd>START</kbd> on the shelf, on both devices.

Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald can switch between cable and wireless with <kbd>SELECT</kbd> on the link screen.

If slot says "Please switch to gpSP", the game needs the wireless adapter. Change the emulator with <kbd>START</kbd> on the shelf. See [Playing Games](playing.md).

## While you're linked

- The game keeps running behind menus. Pausing one device would freeze the other.
- Fast-forward, rewind, loading states and opening the state switcher are all disabled.
- A badge shows whether you're Hosting or Joined.
- If the other device goes quiet for 2 seconds, the link ends.
- If the other player ends the link, you'll see "Your friend unplugged".
